<div class="DESCRIPTION">
    Chicken Adobo is a type of Filipino chicken stew. 
    Chicken pieces are marinated in soy sauce and spices, 
    pan-fried, and stewed until tender. The dish gained popularity 
    because of its delicious taste and ease in preparation.

    It tastes just right and the cooking time is around 30 minutes. 
    The best way to eat chicken adobo is to have it with warm white rice. 
    The combo is simply known as Chicken Adobo and Rice. Pouring some of the 
    adobo sauce over rice before eating is a good idea because it makes it more 
    flavorful.
    <br>
    <br>
    The famous Chicken Adobo originated in the Philippines. The dish is prepared 
    using the Inadobo style of cooking. It means cooking meat or seafood with 
    vinegar and mostly soy sauce. It is a popular method during the olden days 
    when refrigerators and freezers were not yet available because vinegar helps 
    extend the shelf life of food. Another popular variation is pork adobo using 
    pork belly,
    <br>
    <br>
    Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and like all 
    traditional dishes, there are many variations – including different proteins like 
    pork and beef.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fundamentally though, the key ingredients are the right balance of soy sauce, vinegar, 
    black pepper and sugar that create an incredibly sticky glaze that has a depth of flavour 
    like it’s been slow cooked – but it’s not!
    <br>
    <br>
    Chicken slices cooked in soy sauce and vinegar with garlic. This is a delicious 
    Filipino chicken dish that you can eat for lunch with warm white rice.

    Preparation:

<ol>
    <div class="INGREDIENTS2">
    <li>Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it 
    more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. 
    If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 
    30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it.</li><br>
    <li>Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. 
    This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating 
    for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy 
    sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also 
    possible to include the vinegar in this step.</li><br>
    <li>The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will 
    be used later on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part.
    It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice
    for presentation.</li><br>
    <li>Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. 
    The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in 
    low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.</li><br>
    <li>Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. 
    I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.</li><br>
    <li>Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered 
    cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.</li><br>
