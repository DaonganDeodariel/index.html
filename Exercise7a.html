    <p>When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place 
    in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead 
    Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for 
    the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal 
    surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers knowledge, of the Indigenous Race and their 
    Culture, for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while 
    simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity.</p></div>

<div class="TEXT"><p>A soldier wakes up in someone else's body and discovers he's part of an experimental government

    <p>Army Captain Colter Stevens finds himself

    Chicago. He occupies the body of teacher going to work on that train and is confused as to what he is 
    doing or why he is there as his last memory is of flying his helicopter on a combat mission in Afghanistan.
    Those in charge of the program explain to him that there is a bomb on the train, and that he must locate 
    it.</p></div>
