        Computer Science and IT Courses, The Next Direction of Course Seekers
    </div>

<br>

 <div class="PARAGRAPH1">
    The annual JobsCentral Learning survey findings revealed a significant 
    surge of interest towards Computer Science and Information Technology 
    (IT) courses with 15 percent of the respondent’s votes. Taking the second 
    spot on the list of top five most preferred courses for 2016 is Business 
    Studies and Management. 
</div>

<br>

<body><div class="PARAGRAPH2">
With technology spearheading its 
way through almost every industry, 
the need for technology-related skills 
have never been more pressing. It is no 
wonder that Computer Science and IT courses 
have made its way to the top five most preferred 
course this year as the second most popular course
of study. In comparison with last year’s results, 
Computer Science and IT courses jumped five spots 
and outdid perennial favourites such as Finance, 
Investment and Accounting courses which all fared 
slightly poorer. 
</div>
<br>
<body><div class="PARAGRAPH2">
    Preference for Computer Science and IT courses soared 
    this year despite its virtual non-existence in the previous
     years’ ranking. This preference can be attributed to three factors. 
     Namely, the perception that technology based companies are the future, 
     current companies adopting technology in their operations and Singapore’s 
     dream of being a Smart Nation.
</div>
<br>
<body><div class="PARAGRAPH2">
    In an increasingly digitalised world, technological firms are seen 
    by many as vital firms and the main economic driver of our future. 
    With technology giants such as Google and Facebook setting up shop 
    in Singapore and an increase in technology start-ups, the IT industry 
    is posited to be an exciting one filled with tremendous growth potential.
</div>
<br>
<body><div class="PARAGRAPH2">
    Apart from technology based companies, other sectors recognise that incorporating 
    technology into their business model is an important step to take in order to remain 
    current to their audience. These include shifting marketing strategies to a digital 
    platform, and reading data analytics to better understand the audience.
</div>
<br>
<body><div class="PARAGRAPH2">
    Lastly, the Singapore government is making a strong push for the IT industry as it 
    has plans to be the world’s first Smart Nation. Funds have been dedicated to expand 
    training schemes to equip Singaporeans with relevant IT skills and foster IT talents 
    in a bid to strengthen our workforce.
</div>
<body><div class="PARAGRAPH2">
    With these aforementioned contributing factors, current and future in-demand skills 
    are projected to be IT related. As such, technology related disciplines and courses 
    once shunned by many are now finding favour with the masses.
</div>
<br>
<br>


<div class="PARAGRAPH3"> The findings used in this article was drawn from the annual JobsCentral Learning survey conducted
by CareerBuilder Singapore which remains the most comprehensive study done on the higher education 
landscape in Singapore. The JobsCentral Learning survey 2016/17 was based on a total sample size of 
4,580 respondents.
